Data Slices are filtered subsets of your data based on metadata. They allow you to focus on specific segments of your document repository without affecting the entire dataset.

## Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Targeted Processing** | Run extraction on only relevant documents (e.g., just 2024 contracts) |
| **Focused Analysis** | View and analyze specific document categories |
| **Efficient Workflows** | Avoid reprocessing already-enriched documents |
| **Team Collaboration** | Share team-specific data slices with team members |
| **Controllability** | Run downstream applications on controlled data |

## Data Slice Properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Name** | User-defined identifier |
| **Description** | Optional notes about what's included |
| **Data Connector** | Which Data Connector it's derived from |
| **Document Count** | Number of files matching the conditions |
| **Conditions** | Filter rules that define the slice based on metadata |

## How Data Slices Work

    subgraph source [Data Source]
        ALL[All Documents: 10,000]
    end
    
    subgraph slices [Data Slices]
        S1[2024 Contracts: 1,247]
        S2[High-Value Invoices: 89]
        S3[Unprocessed: 5,892]
    end
    
    ALL --> S1
    ALL --> S2
    ALL --> S3
```

## Example Data Slices

| Slice Name | Filter Conditions | Document Count |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| "2024 Contracts" | Document Type = Contract AND Year = 2024 | 1,247 |
| "High-Value Invoices" | Invoice Amount > $10,000 | 89 |
| "Documents with PII" | SSN_Detected = Yes OR Email_Detected = Yes | 3,521 |
| "Unprocessed Files" | Document Type = null | 5,892 |

<Tip>
Use Data Slices to create focused workflows. For example, process only untagged documents to avoid reprocessing, or create a slice of high-priority documents for immediate attention.

## Creating Effective Data Slices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Goal">
    Identify what subset of documents you need to work with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Filter Conditions">
    Select metadata fields and values that define your target documents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Combine Conditions">
    Use AND/OR logic to create precise filters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Document Count">
    Check that the slice captures the expected number of documents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply to Workflows">
    Use the slice in Projects or for targeted exports.
  </Step>
</Steps>
